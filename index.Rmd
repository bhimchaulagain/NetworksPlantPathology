### Course overview  

Plant disease epidemiology addresses how interactions among plants, pathogens, vectors, the abiotic environment, and human decision-making result in the occurrence and spread of plant disease.  Epidemiology also represents the interface between plant pathology and other disciplines, such as meteorology and social sciences.  
\  
\  

This course addresses classical approaches to epidemiology as well as frontiers that make use of new big data opportunities.  The course provides an introduction to the R programming environment, data science applications in epidemiology and epidemiological analyses using R.  The course includes a combination of lectures to provide background information, discussion of current literature, computational analysis workshops to illustrate concepts, and individual projects to allow participants to apply ideas to systems that particularly interest them.  
\  
\  

In the individual projects, each participant will select a disease of particular interest, assemble a portfolio of epidemiological information related to that disease, write a short proposal including an experimental design to collect important new data related to the disease, and evaluate regional management strategies for the disease in an epidemiological synthesis.  
\ 
\  

The course emphasizes concepts and use of existing tools, while at the same time it will offer a basis for the development of new tools for participants interested in further steps.  
\  
\  


### Course learning objectives  

Participants who have completed this course will be able toâ€¦  

* explain and apply general epidemiological concepts, such as disease progress over time, pathogen dispersal, sampling strategies, and spatial analyses
* broadly understand and discuss journal articles addressing plant disease epidemiology
* design basic epidemiological studies, in designed experiments and observational studies
* analyze basic epidemiological studies using R
